I am an evolutionary ecologist with interests in social evolution, host-parasite interactions, thermal adaptation and science communication. 

I am currently in the final year of my PhD, based in the [Bourke group](https://andrewbourkeresearch.com) at the University of East Anglia. My PhD research focuses on the molecular and behavioural mechanisms underlying social evolution in bumblebees, using the Tree Bumblebee - a recent UK colonist - as a study system.

Alongside my PhD, I work as a research techniciani n the [Gage group](https://matthewgagelab.com) on a NERC-funded project investigating the impacts of heatwaves on insect reproduction.

I am an evolutionary ecologist based at the University of East Anglia, with interests in social evolution, host-parasite interactions, thermal adaptation and science communication. 

Currently, I am a final year PhD student in the [Bourke group](https://andrewbourkeresearch.com), where my research focuses on the molecular and behavioural mechanisms underlying social evolution in bumblebees, using the Tree Bumblebee - a recent UK colonist - as a study system. Alongside my PhD, I work as a research technician on a project investigating heatwave impacts on insect reproduction in the [Gage group](https://matthewgagelab.com).
